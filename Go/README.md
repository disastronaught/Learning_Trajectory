I talked with a red teamer about some DLL injection and AV subversion techniques using C++ and noticed
an intermixing of C#, C++ and..... Go? I had limited knowledge of this language, admittedly, and
decided to blast through the codecademy tutorial a few times to really see what it was hiding.
It turns out, Go compiles on the GC compiler and has slight syntactical differences with C++, but it's
a lot less verbose and has several admirable differences. The imports come with some functionality like 
naming conventions and methodology which I'd never experienced in C# or C++. I like this, because it means
overall, it's lighter weight than other GCC compiled scripts. In short, it saves memory on microcontrollers.
I'll post the progression here in the GO folder and see how it turns out.
