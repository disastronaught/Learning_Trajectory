I needed to use something faster, over time, than Tableau... (I saw that with some hesitation, because engineering in Tableau is handy)
Let's just go with custom. Tableau is great, but there's some drawbacks in the marks vs filters range when loading particular data sets in .csv/xlsx.
With an analysis language, I can rip sections of raw metrics and pipe them in a sense to functions which return more useful statistical output.
