```{r}
#creating a list of similarly formatted variables (vector) is similar to building a two dimensional array in C type languages
#In R it's a little simpler and using methods to analyze the baser format and printing locations is also easier
#what's also neat about listing analysis of the data set itself is our ability to use methods like 'typeof' and 'length' etc.. to micro analyze 

phone <- c(123, 456, 7890)
print(length(phone))
print(typeof(phone))
```
