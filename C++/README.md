This is a bit late on formality, but I'm plowing through the codecademy 11 hour module to trim up my development speed
when I write programs for the Arduino and in the Arduino IDE for use on ESP32 and ESP8266 devices. Strangely enough, I 
enjoy the C++ flow and syntax moreso than C#. At least at this point, it appears more line and block and quite neat 
when compared to many things I've built in C#. We'll see what this course has to offer and if any of it is usefull on ESP.
There's a C# malware dev course I've been chipping away at through teachable called Red Team Sorcery, and I might convert some
of the C2 node scripts into C++ to see if they're more user friendly.
