In preparation for the Certified Red Team Operator (CRTO) course by ZeroPoint Security, I am doing a few hours/day on a 
teachables course called Offensive C# through Red Team Sorcery. Yes, there'll be some Python in regards to C2 servers and 
a lot of the introductory code will be incredible simply compared to some of the other things posted in the C# repo...
it's posted here for continuity and reference. Certain functions not covered in C# that are used here such as ReadKey() are
included for my own reference. Feel free to experiment with what you see here and learn from it if you want. This is posted in
the public domain as a reference to one ethical penetration tester's journey and not as an instructional. I hold no responsibility 
for those who use these or other threat emulation techniques to conduct illegal activity. (Hack VMs not your neighbors.)
